# Contacts-List-Application

## Overview
This is a simple contacts list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete contacts, following the CRUD API operations. The application is built using Python and the Flask web framework for the backend, and React for the frontend. The application is also connected to a SQLite database to store the contacts. This project comes from a tutorial by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppslXOR7TA), and this repository is my implementation of the tutorial with the aim of learning how to build a full-stack application using Python and React.
